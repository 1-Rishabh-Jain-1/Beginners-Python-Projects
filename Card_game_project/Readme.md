#WAR Card Game
The card game starts by dividing the deck into two halves after shuffling. Each player draws a single card and compares the rank of the card, the player with the higher card rank wins and gets both the cards. 

If both the players draw cards with same rank, itâ€™s a war condition. 
Each player has to draw 5 cards out of their deck and set aside. Whoever wins the next round, gets all his/her cards back including the 5 +1 cards drawn by the other player. 

Whoever runs out of cards, loses and the other player wins.
